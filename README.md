# BMI-Flutter-App
BMI-Flutter-App is a BMI Calculator build as a part of my journey into Flutter framework.

App allows user to provide his/her height (in metters) and weight (in kilograms) in order to calculate Body Mass Index. It also provides a table with BMI range and description (for example `Overweight`) to inform user what his/her BMI means.
